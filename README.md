# 🚀 Hosting a Static Website on AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux + Apache)

This project demonstrates how I deployed a full static website template on an
AWS EC2 instance using **Amazon Linux** and the **Apache Web Server**.
This project demonstrates how I hosted two different static websites on an AWS EC2 instance:

1️⃣ My own custom static welcome page (written manually in HTML)
2️⃣ A professional template website (2095_level) downloaded and hosted using Apache

This was my first hands-on experience with cloud computing, Linux commands,
Apache setup, and security group configuration.
